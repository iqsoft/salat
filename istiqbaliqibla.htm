Seventeen months after the Hegira, at the third rak’at of the early
afternoon or late afternoon prayer of a Tuesday in the middle of
Sha’bân, Muslims were commanded to turn towards Ka’ba. According to
Hanafî and Mâlikî Madhhabs, namâz will be accepted if the opening
between the crosswise directions of the optic nerves includes Ka’ba.
This angle is approximately 45°. Istanbul’s Qibla direction is
approximately 29° east of south. This angle is called the <b>angle of Qibla. </b>A
city’s Qibla direction depends on its longitude and latitude. For
finding south in the northern hemisphere, the direction to the sun at
zawâl is used or the face of a clock adjusted to the local zawalî time
is held horizontally, its face being towards the sky and its hour-hand
towards the sun: bisector of the angle between the hour-hand and number
twelve approximately points to south. The nearer the declination of sun
and the equation of time to zero, the more precise is the result.
Istanbul's Qibla direction can be found by either one of the following
two ways: 1- By way of the angle of Qibla; 2- By way of Qibla hour. 1-
Suppose you are standing with your face pointing due south (somewhere
in Istanbul), in alignment with the longitude passing through Istanbul;
now if you turn eastwards by as much as the angle of Qibla, you will be
facing the Qibla. The angle of Qibla is calculated as follows:
Longitude of the blessed city of Mekka from Greenwich is &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harflamdaus.jpg">&nbsp;=39°50' or 39.83° and its latitude is &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi.jpg">&nbsp;=21°26' or 21.43°. Since Istanbul’s longitude is&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harflamda.jpg">&nbsp; =29° and its latitude is&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp;=41°, 
the difference between their longitudes is 10°50' or 10.83°, and the difference 
between their latitudes is 19°34' or 19.57°.</p><p align="justify">If
Istanbul’s approximate angle of Qibla, as measured from the direction
of south, is, say, Q, the following approximate equation, obtained
utilizing the geometrical explanation in the book <b>Ma’rifatnâma, </b>can be written,    <br><br>
	</p>
	<div align="center">
		<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/FormulKibleacisi.jpg"></div><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify"><b>Note: </b>Since
the difference, d, between the longitudes of Istanbul and Mekka
mukarrama is smaller than 60°, Q is almost the same as the result
obtained with the following exact formula. If d is greater than 120°, Q
can be found using (&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harflamdaus.jpg">&nbsp;=-140.17° and &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi.jpg">&nbsp;=-21.43°
instead of 39.83° and 21.43°, respectively) for the place symmetrical
to Mekka with respect to the center of the earth by means of the
approximate formula. By subtracting the result from 180° , Q is found.

to the west in the eastern region of the Qibla and vice versa. The Q
found with this formula should have a (-) sign for the eastern and (+)
sign for the western regions. In case of opposite results, the angle of
Qibla is found by adding (+ 180°) or (-180°). For example, for Karachi

Finding the Qibla direction in Istanbul by way of the city's Qibla
hour: In the figure on the right hand side on the previous page, the
point B is the point at which the Qibla direction CS is perpendicular
to a declination circle or meridian AB. In the right angled spherical
triangle ABS, using the Napier equations, cos (90°-&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp;) = sin &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp;= cot i x cot Q, and as  tan A x cot A=1, sin&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp; = (1/tan i) x (1/tan Q). Hence, tan i =1/(sin&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg"> x

In the triangle ABS, cos i = tan &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp;x cot d and, therefore, cot d = cos i / tan&nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp;, and hence, cos(i+H) = tan &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harfsigma.jpg">&nbsp; x cos i ÷ tan &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi_002.jpg">&nbsp; .

, the hour angle H, that is, the arc CN, is obtained as 1 hour 45
minutes. Kadûsî notes in his annotation to Rub’-i-dâira: “The cursor
set (for the date), when moved to the line of qibla, the complement of
the angle indicated by the string on the arc of altitude is the
supplement of the hour angle of Ýstanbul’s time of Qibla. When it is
divided by 15, the result is the hour angle H.” The standard <b>time of Qibla </b>at
which the sun is on the direction of Qibla of a given location for each
day can be calculated by subtracting from 12:00 hours the time
corresponding to the hour angle and combining the result with the
Equation of Time and the difference of longitude from the Standard
Meridian. In the example given above, (the standard time of Qibla) is
10 hr 33 min. The adhânî Qibla time is calculated as 5 hr 6 min by
subtracting the time corresponding to the hour angle and one Temkin
from the time of dhuhr-i-adhânî (the adhânî time for noon prayer). If
one turns to the sun at this time, one will face the Qibla. If the
Qibla is to the east of the south, the sun is also in the east, the
time is before noon and the H in the time equation will have a (-)
sign. <img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harfsigma.jpg"> = the sun’s declination. When  &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/harfsigma.jpg">&nbsp; = &nbsp;<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/15179harffi.jpg">&nbsp;
(Mekka) = 21.43°, the sun will be exactly overhead the Ka’ba twice a
year. At those times, (i.e. at each of the two Qibla hours,) anybody
turning to the sun will be facing the Qibla.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">Ahmed
Ziyâ Beg found Q=29° for Istanbul by taking somewhat bigger values for
the longitudes and latitudes and using tables of logarithms of
trigonometric functions. The mihrâb of the mosque at the Kandilli quay
in Istanbul was calculated by him in this way at the time of
restoration of the mosque.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">By
turning thirty - one degrees eastward from the direction of south found
by a compass, Qibla will be faced in Istanbul. But the needle of a
compass points to magnetic poles, which, in fact, are not the poles of
the Earth’s axis. And the locations of magnetic poles change in process
of time. They complete one rotation around true poles in a period of
about six hundred years. The angle between the magnetic direction and
the true polar direction is called the <b>magnetic deviation. </b>Every
location has a different angle of deviation. There are populated places
where the needle of the compass even deviates 30° from the south to the
east (+) or to the west (-). And a place’s angle of deviation changes
yearly. Then, if the direction <b>of Qibla </b>is found with a compass, the angle of magnetic deviation has to be added to or subtracted from the angle of Qibla. 
	Istanbul’s angle of magnetic deviation is approximately +3°. When we turn 
	eastward for 28° +3°=31° from the south direction found with a compass in

Istanbul, we will face the Qibla.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">If
the south direction is found with the help of the Pole-Star or with a
clock or by means of the meridian line drawn on the ground, it is not
necessary to add the angle of deviation to the angle of Qibla. The
direction of Qibla is found by turning 29° eastward (from the southerly
direction thereby found) in <b>Istanbul. </b>For doing this you place
your clock (or watch) on a table horizontally and turn the figure 6
towards south. When the hour-hand is moved to the position over 5 it
points to the Qibla.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">It
is permissible, even when performing a namâz that is fard, to deviate
from the direction of Qibla when there is the fear of illness, enemy or
thief, or by mistake, but it is obligatory to turn towards the Qibla
when performing it on a ship or train.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">A
musâfir travelling on a ship or train must begin the fard namâz by
standing towards the Qibla and put a compass somewhere near the place
he will prostrate. He must turn towards the Qibla as the ship or train
changes direction. Or someone else should make him turn right or left.
If his chest deviates from the Qibla when performing the namâz, his
namâz becomes nullified. For, a ship or a train is like one’s own home.
It is not like an animal. Since the fard namâz of those who cannot turn
toward the Qibla on buses, on trains, on ships when the sea is rough
will not be acceptable, they can imitate Shâfi’î Madhhab as long as
they travel and perform the late afternoon prayer together with the
early afternoon prayer and the night prayer together with the evening
prayer, one right after the other. Likewise, if a person in Hanafî
Madhhab will not be able to turn towards the Qibla on the way after
starting the journey, he must perform the late afternoon prayer right
after performing the early afternoon prayer at the time of the early
afternoon prayer when they halt somewhere for some time during the day,
and perform the evening prayer and the night prayer together at the
time of the night prayer when they halt somewhere during the night, and
when intending to start each of those four prayers he must intend, that
is, pass through his heart the thought: “I am performing it by
imitating <b>Shâfi’î </b>Madhhab.” According to Shâfi’î and Mâlikî
Madhhabs, when a person on a long - distance journey goes to his
hometown or to a place where he intends to stay more than three days
excluding the days when he enters and goes out of the city, or when he
stays more than eighteen days at a place where he went for some
business which he thought would take him less than four days, he
becomes muqîm (settled). He will not become safarî unless
he intends to travel to a distance of not less than 80 km when he
leaves the place. Hadrat Ibni Hajar-i Makkî says in his book <b>Fatâwâ-i Fiqhiyya: </b>“If
a travelling (safarî) person postpones his early afternoon prayer in
order to perform it together with his late afternoon prayer but becomes
muqîm (settled) after the time for early afternoon prayer is over
before he performs his early afternoon prayer, he makes qadâ of his
early afternoon prayer (performs it) first. He does not become sinful
for having postponed his early afternoon prayer until its time is over.
Anyone who imitates Mâlikî or Shâfi’î Madhhab because he has a crowned
or filled tooth in his mouth, must not make qasr (shorten) the fard
prayers where he stays more than three and less than fifteen days. If
he does, his fard prayers which he performs as two rak’ats will not be
valid. If he prays four rak’ats, it is sahîh (acceptable), although it
is makrûh, in the Hanafî. Similarly, one’s namâz is sahîh (valid)
according to Mâlikî Madhhab if one’s skin comes in contact with that of
a nâmahram woman or if one’s ablution (wudu’) is broken during namâz.
As is written in the final paragraph of the fourth chapter, this person
cannot combine (perform by jem’) his prayers where he stays as safarî
(traveller) if there is no haraj. (Please see the book of Enddless
Bliss fourth fascicle chapter 4.)</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">Although
it is not permissible to determine the beginning of the Ramadân-i
sherîf beforehand by using calendars or by calculation, it is
permissible to find out about the Qibla by calculation, pole star
[compass], etc. or prayer times by using a calendar prepared by
astronomical calculations. For, though they will not be found out
accurately by sole calculation or instrumental observation and
analysis, they will be guessed strongly. Finding out the Qibla or
prayer times by strong conviction is permissible.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">At
places where there is no mihrâb and where the Qibla cannot be found by
calculation or with the help of the Pole-Star [a compass], true Muslims
who know which direction the Qibla is, must be consulted. We should not
ask disbelievers, fâsiq Muslims, or children. Disbelievers and fâsiq
Muslims can be believed in <b>mu’amalât</b> (business transactions and social dealings), but not in <b>diyânât </b>[worships].
When you have no one with you who knows about the Qibla, you need not
look for one. You must search for it yourself and then perform namâz
towards the direction you have decided to be the Qibla. If later you
find out that it was the wrong direction you do not have to perform the
namâz again.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">The Qibla
is not the building of Ka’ba; it is its building plot.
That is, that space from the Earth to the ’Arsh is the Qibla. For this
reason, a person who is down in a well, [under the sea], on top of a
high mountain [or on a plane] can perform namâz in that direction. [For
being a hadji&nbsp;<sup><b>[<a name="l21211" href="#l11211">1</a>]</b></sup>&nbsp; a Muslim visits not the building of Ka’ba but its building plot. He who visits another place cannot become a hadji].</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">Hadrat Ibni Hajar-i Makkî says in his book <b>Fatâwâ-i-fiqhiyya: </b>“It
is not permissible to change today’s shape of the building of Ka’ba. It
is harâm. Today’s building was constructed by Hajjâj. When the Khalîfa
Hârûn-ur-Rashîd wanted to have it changed in order to put it in the
right shape given by Abdullah Ibni Zubayr, Imâm-i Mâlik, ‘rahmatullâhi
ta’âlâ ’alaih’, prevented him. If from now on anybody changes it, it is
wâjib for us to demolish the changes, provided we will not cause fitna
or give damage to the original building. Otherwise it is not wâjib.”</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">If
one is ill or when there is the danger that one’s possessions may be
stolen or it may cause the ship one is on board to sink or if there is
the danger of a wild animal or of being seen by the enemy or if one
will not be able to mount one’s animal without help in case one gets
down from it or if one’s companions will not wait for one in case one
makes one’s animal stand towards the Qibla, one combines (jem’) two
salâts. If jem’ is impossible, one performs even the fard namâz by
standing toward any direction one can manage, and does not perform it
again later. For, one has not caused these excuses oneself, but they
have happened willy-nilly. If a person who does not know the direction
of Qibla performs namâz without looking at the mihrâb or asking someone
who knows or trying to find out, his namâz will not be accepted even if
he has found the Qibla by chance. But if he finds out after the namâz
that he has found the right direction it will be accepted. If he finds
it out during the namâz it will not be accepted. If he inquired for the
Qibla but has did perform the namâz in the direction which he had
decided to be right, he has to perform it again even if he understands
that he has found the right direction by chance. Likewise, a person who
performs namâz though he thinks that he does not have an ablution, that
his clothes are najs, or that it is not prayer time yet, and who finds
out later that his thought has not been correct, performs the namâz
again.</p><p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">[To determine
the direction of Qibla, a rod is erected (vertically) on the ground at
a place taking sunlight. Or, something with some weight such as a key
or a piece of stone is tied to the end of a piece of string and let to
hang freely. At the time of Qibla written on the current day's sheet of
calendar the shadow of the rod or of the string will show the Qibla
direction and, the Sun being on the Qibla side of the shadow, its place
will show the Qibla.]

<br><br><b>QIBLA ANGLES FOR PLACES WITH VARIOUS LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES</b><br><br>
<img src="istiqbaliqibla_files/LongitudeAngles.jpg">
<p style="text-indent: 35pt;" align="justify">Longitudes are printed in
rows at the top and bottom of the table in 5° intervals and Latitudes
in the middle column in 2° intervals. Longitudes with a dashed line
under them are to the west (-) and the rest are to the east (+) of
London. Longitudes in the lines 1 and 2 are for the northern and 3 and
4 for the southern hemisphere. The figure on the cross-section of the
column including the longitude and the line including the latitude for
a place gives the angle of Qibla Q for it. The Qibla will be faced by
turning Q degrees from the south to the west for lines (1 and 4) and to
the east for lines (2 and 3). These Q angles are measured from the
geographical south found by either the Sun or the Pole-star. If the
measurement is made with a compass, the magnetic deviation (of the
location) must be taken into account. </p></td>
