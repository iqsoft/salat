><FONT size="+1"></B>The five Islamic prayers are named Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha. The timing of these five prayers varies from place to place and from day to day. It is obligatory for Muslims to perform these prayers at the correct time.  The prayer times for any given location on earth may be determined mathematically if the latitude and longitude of the location are known. However, the theoretical determination of prayer times is a lengthy process.

></DIV
><P 

><FONT size="+1"></B>Fajr starts with the morning twilight (dawn) whilst isha starts at the end of the evening twilight (dusk). There is some debate as to which twilight angle should be used in the calculation of fajr/isha. For a discussion on the subject, I refer you to Dr. Ilyas' book: Astronomy of Islamic Times for the Twenty- first Century. Here is a brief extract from chapter five of Dr. Ilyas' book (in italics):  </P
><P 

><I>&quot; In modern times, astronomical twilight (18 degrees) has come to be widely used for the determination of isha and fajr times. As the average intensity curve of evening twilight indicates, the flux decreases to a minimum level, and thus it would seem appropriate that even </I><I>f</I><I>or Islamic purposes, this should indicate a reasonable startin</I><I>g</I><I> value </I><I>f</I><I>or the end o</I><I>f</I><I> 'astro-lslamic twili</I><I>g</I><I>ht' (AIT). Indeed, 18 de</I><I>g</I><I>rees depression was a commonl</I><I>y</I><I> used value </I><I>f</I><I>or </I><I>f</I><I>a</I><I>j</I><I>r and isha in the medieval period, when it must have been </I></P

><P 

><I>based on careful observations. Nevertheless, slight variations from this value- between 16 degrees and 20 degrees- were also used during the medieval period. According to King, 20 degrees and 16 degrees were the parameters used by Ibn Yunus for morning and evening AIT respectively, whereas 19 degrees and 17 degrees were the parameters used by various Egyptian astronomers. Nasr also refers to 19 degrees being used in the Islamic world for the fajr and isha times. King has confirmed that although Muslim astronomers widely used 18 degrees/l8 degrees symmetrical values or a slight variation to 19 degrees/17 degrees (morning/evening)-and in a few (earlier) cases even 20 degrees/16 degrees values were adopted-no record has been found of the use of a value as </I><I>s</I><I>mall as 15 degrees. This is of specific interest to us because a few years ago, values of 15 degrees/15 degrees for both AlTs were proposed by Bagvi on the authority of Maulana Rashid Ahmad Ludianvi of Karachi, who is reported to have made some observations personally. Indeed, I myself followed Bagvi in preparing the first South Australian Islamic Time Table, although I did consider the need to examine the matter very carefully and introduced a distinct term for it. Subsequently, this 15 degrees </I><I>p</I><I>roposition has come under criticism and is apparently not proved by others' observations made in recent years in that particular area (Karachi). Concern on this matter is obviously understandable, because an erroneous delay in the beginning of fajr would have serious implications for the beginning of the Fast. One of the useful studies arguing against this 15 degrees depression for AIT is that of Latiff, who claims to have conducted some observational work. Unfortunately, Latiff has argued for a fixed 18 degrees/18 degrees case for all over the globe-no less and no more. This, it seems, may not be the true situation either as there seems to be some room for geographical variability and perhaps 18 degrees serves as a good upper limit only. The value for morning AIT has widely been used as 18 degrees, although a practice of using 20 degrees prevails in Egypt and Indonesia/Malaysia (under Egyptian influence, apparently owing to the concerned persons having been trained there). Possibly, 20 degrees is taken as a safeguard because of the sanctification of the Fast. On the other hand, the use of smaller values than 18 degrees for India and Yemen has been reported to me in personal communications by Abdul Hafiz Maniar of Surat, India, and Dr. M.M. Qurashi of Islamabad, Pakistan, respectively. However, as we have noted elsewhere, in general, at 18 degrees depression, no detectable trace of twilight flux will be found, meaning that 18 degrees represents an upper limit. &quot; </I></P

><FONT size="+1"></B>Several conventions for the calculation of Fajr and Isha are already in use in various countries. Fajr and Isha times are usually calculated using fixed twilight angles as discussed above but some countries also use a method involving adding/subtracting a fixed interval of time to sunset/sunrise respectively . Using the latter method, a time interval is subtracted from sunrise to obtain Fajr whilst the interval is added to sunset to obtain Isha. The methods used by some Islamic organisations are are summarised in the following table: </P

><FONT size="+1"></B>To calculate the prayer times for a certain place we need to know the latitude (B) and longitude (L) of the location and its reference longitude (R). B and L may be obtained from an atlas and R may be calculated by multiplying 15 by the difference between local time and GMT (i.e. 15 x Time Band). We also need to know two astronomical measures called the declination angle of the sun (D) and the real time-mean time difference, also known as the equation of time (T).  </P
><P 

>Declination is the angular distance between a celestial object and the celestial equator. The Declination and the Right Ascension are used together to give the position of a star with reference to the celestial equator and the vernal equinox respectively.  The equation of time is a correction to be added to apparent solar time, as read on a sundial, to obtain mean solar time, as commonly used. This difference is a consequence of the ellipticity and tilt of the Earth's orbit, causing the irregular apparent movement of the Sun across the sky. </P
