<p>The astronomer who is said to have studied the solar system and
presented the heliocentric theory for the first time was a Greek, known
by the name of Aristarchus of Samos. He died in 270 BC. However, this
theory of the sun being at the centre, and of the earth revolving
around it, never gained popularity in those early times.</p>
<p>Then came the age of Ptolemy, who lived in the second century AD.
Ptolemy's astronomical system represented the earth as the fixed centre
of the universe, with the sun and the moon, and other stars and planets
revolving around it. Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler carried out
researches which ultimately proved falsity. But it was the Muslims, who
first transferred to Europe the concept of the earth being round and
the almost correct concept of the causes of the ebb and flow of the
tides.</p>
<p>This geocentric theory of the universe appeared to be in conformity
with the beliefs the Christians had developed after Jesus Christ. These
beliefs were give the final seal of approval at the famous Church
Council held at Nicaea, a city in Asia Minor, in AD 325. After the
acceptance of Christianity by Constantine the Great (280-337), the
faith spread all over Roman territory. Now vested with tremendous
power, the Christians patronized, in particular, the theory of Ptolemy.
The curtain of darkness fell over the heliocentric theory of
Aristarchus. The wrong concept about the revolution of the earth
remained predominant for such a long period of time, it was due to the
error of regarding something non-sacred as sacred. The Christians
believed that the earth was a sacred sphere, being the birthplace of
the son of God (Jesus). Because of this belief, they found the notion
that the earth was the centre around which the whole universe revolved
exactly in accordance with their religious beliefs. It was this idea of
the earth's sacredness which came in the way of the Christians making
any further investigation.</p>
<p>Of geocentricity, the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica (1984)</i> says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>"There was no further scope for cosmology in the model, which continued to be taught and used almost everywhere until the 17<sup>th</sup> century."</blockquote>
<p>It was not until 1495 that Copernicus arrived at the conclusion that
the earth was not the centre of the universe. After a long period of
research devoted to astronomical studies, he was forced to conclude
that the planets revolved around the sun. But, fearing the opposition
of the Church, he refrained from publishing his findings until 1543.</p>
<p>The Muslims, however, did not suffer from the error of regarding as
sacred that which was non-sacred. They were in a position to reflect
upon matters of scientific interest with open minds, and in a purely
academic way. When they found that the heliocentric theory was more
rational, they accepted it without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Edward McNall Burns writers that the heliocentric theory developed
by Aristarchus (310-320 BC), although destined to fall into oblivion
for four hundred years, has today become an established fact. This is
after many centuries of men's minds being dominated by Ptolemy's
geocentric theory.</p>
<p>Of all the subjects developed by the Spanish Muslims, there was none
brought to a higher degree of perfection than science. In fact, in this
field, their successes were such as to have no parallel in history.
They distinguished themselves in the fields of astronomy, mathematics,
physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. As McNall Burns writes: </p>
<blockquote>"Despite their reverence for Aristotle, they did not
hesitate to criticize his notion of a universe of concentric spheres
with the earth at the centre, and they admitted the possibility that
the earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun."</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims arriving at the correct hypothesis of the solar system's
functioning was made possible only because Islam had broken down the
walls of conditioned thinking which had acted as a barrier to man's
intellectual progress. As soon as this artificial barrier was out of
the way, the caravan of human thought began to move on its journey with
a hitherto unimaginable rapidity. And thus it brought us finally to the
spectacular scientific feats of the present century.</p>
<p>In 830 AD, Al-Mamun established in Baghdad his famous Bayt al
Hikmah, a combination library, academy and translation bureau, and an
astronomical observatory. This work started under the patronage of the
stats. Al-Mamun's astronomers performed one of the most delicate
geodetic operation -- the measuring of the length of a a terrestrial
degree. The object was to determine the size of the earth and its
circumgerence on the assumption that the earth was round. The
measurement, carried out on the plain of Sinjar, north of the
Euphrated, and near Palmyra, yielded 562 Arabic miles as the length of
a degree of the meridian -- a remarkably accurate result, exceeding the
real length of the degree at that place by about 2877 feet. This would
make the circumference of the earth 20,400 mules and its diameter 6500.
Among those who took part in this operation were the sons of Musa ibn
Shakir and al-Khwarizmi, whose tables, revised a century and a half
later by the Spanish astronomer Maslamah Maslamah al-Majrity and
translated into Latin in 1126 by Adelard of Bath, became the bases for
other works both in the East and the West.</p>
<p>In those days, Muslims were so ahead of other nations that when they
were driver out of Spain, the astrolabes they left behind, by means of
which they had studied heavenly bodies, were turned into the clock
tower of a church, as the Christians did not understand their use.</p>

<p>Galileo (d. 1442) is generally considered to be the inventor of the
telescope. But the truth is that long before his time, Abu Ishaq ibn
Jundub (d.767) had already made observations of the heavens. He had
devised certain rules for observing distant objects and, in accordance
with those rules, he had invented a telescopic instrument. It was this
initial telescope which was further developwed by Galieleo, and which
ws the actual forerunner of the now highly perfected electric telescope
of modern time.</p>

<p>Just as diseases have afflicted man in every age, so has the science
of medicine always existed in one form or the other In ancient times,
however, the science of medicine never reached the heights of progress
that it did in the Islamic era and also latterly, in modern times.</p>
<p>It is believed that the beginning of the science of medicine -- a
beginning to be reckoned with -- was made in ancient Greece. The two
very great physicians who were born in ancient Greece were Hippocrates
and Galen. Hippocrates lived in the fifth and fourth century BC.
However, very little is known about his life. The historians of later
times hae estimated that Hippocrates was probably born in 460 BC and
died in 377 BC. Some historians, on the other hand, even have doubts
about his being a historical figure. It has also been questioned
whether the books on philosophy and medicine supposedly writter by
someone else and later attributed to him.</p>
<p>Galen is considered the second most important philosopher and
physicist of this period of antiquity. He was born probably in AD 129
and died in AD 199. Galen had to face stiff opposition in Rome, and
most of his writings were destroyed. The remainder would also have been
lost to posterity if the Arabs had not collected them in the ninth
century and translated them into Arabic. These Arabic translations were
later to reach Europe, in the eleventh century, where they were
translated from Arabic into Latim.</p>
<p>The science of medicine came into being in ancient Greece about 200
years before the Christian era and flourished for another two
centuries. In this way, the whole period extended over about four or
five hundred years. This science did not see any subsequent advance in
Greece itself. Although a European country, Greece did not contribute
anything to the spread of its own medical science in Europe, or to
modern medicine in the West. These facts are proof that the atmosphere
in ancient Greece was not favourable to the progress of medicine.</p>
<p>The Greek medicine which was brought into being by certain
individuals (effort was all at the individual level, as the community
did not give it general recognition) remained hidden away in obscure
books for about one thousand years after its birth. It was only when
these books were translated into Arabic during the Abbasid period
(750-1258), and edited by the Arabs with their own original additions,
that it became possible for this science to find its way to Europe,
thus paving the way for modern medical science.</p>
<p>As the Prophet (pbuh) said, "God has sent the remedy for every
disease in the world except death." This saying of the Prophet (pbuh)
was the declaration of the leader of a revolution. No sooner did he
announce to the world this truth about medicine than history began to
be shaped by it in many practical ways.</p>
<p>Medicine was probably the first Greek science to attract the Arabs
because of its obvious practical importance. Then they developed it to
the extent of establishing medical colleges and hospitals, which did
not exist in Greece. Not merely was it taught in the colleges of Iraq,
but the teaching was accompanied by a flourishing medical service. The
first hospital in Baghdad was founded about the year 800 on the
initiative of the Caliph Harun al Rashid, and records have been
preserved of the founding of four other hospitals there in the first
quarter of the tenth century. A thirteenth century hospital in Cairo is
said to have had accommodation for 8,000 persons. It had separate wards
for male and female patients, as well as for different categories of
ailment. The staff included physicians and surgeons, pharmacists,
attendants of both sexes and administrative officers, and besides
sotr-rooms and a chapel, there were facilities for lecturing and a
library. </p>
<p>The Arabs thus made extraordinary advances in medicine through their
research. The first important physician was Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn
Zakariyya al-Razi (d. 923), known in Europe as Rhazes. He wrote
voluminously on many scientific and philosophic subjects, and over
fifty of his works are extant. His greatest work, <i>Al-Havi,</i> was translated into Latin as the <i>Continens</i>,
(the comprehensive book). It was the first encyclopaedia of all medical
science up to that time, and had to be completed by his disciples after
his death. For each disease he gave the views of Greek, Syrian, Indian,
Persian and Arabic authors, and then added notes on his clinical
observations and expressed a final opinion.</p>
<p>The greatest writer on medicine was Ibn Sina or Avicenna. He was
also one of the two greatest Arabic philosophers. His eminence in
medicine was due to his ability to combine extensive theoretical
knowledge and systamatic thought with acute clinical observation. His
vast <i>Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanun fi't-Tib)</i> was translated into
Latin in the twelfth century and was used much more than the works of
Galen and Hippocrates. It dominated the teaching of medicine in Europe
until at least the end of the sixteenth century. There were sixteen
printed editions of it in the fifteenth century, one being in Hebrew,
twenty editions in the sixteenth century and several more in the
seventeenth. Roughly contemporary with Ibn Sina was the chief Arabic
writer on surgery and surgical instruments, Abul Qasim az-Zohrawi (d.
after 1009), usually known in Latin as Abulcasis.</p>
<p>The gift of careful observation did not disappear and certain
fourteenth century Arab doctors in Spain wrote knowledgeably, about the
plague as they had experienced it in Granada and Almeria.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">TOP</a></p>
<font color="#800000" size="4"><p><a name="Smallpox">Smallpox</a></p>
</font><p>Smallpox is considered one of the most dangerous diseases in
the world. It is a highly contagious disease, characterized by fever
and the appearance of small spots leaving scars in the form of pits.
The symptoms include chill, headache, and backache. The spots appear
about the fourth day. This is a fatal diseas. Even if one survives the
attack the skin is scarred permanently.</p>
<p>According to present records, theis disease was identified in Egypt
in 1122 BC and is also mentioned in ancient Indian books written in
Sanskrit. In the past this disease gripped many countries in the form
of dangerous epidemics. Thousands of people fell prey to it. As far
back as 1156 BC visible evidence in the pock-marked face of the mummy
of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Ramses V, who died in that year. (His embalmed
body was found inside a pyramid). Even then, it took thousands of years
for this dreaded disease to be investigated scientifically.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of the ninth century, subsequent to the
emergence of Islam, that this medical fact was unearthed for the first
time. The first name which became prominent in history in this
connection was that of the well-known Arab physician, Al-Razi
(865-925), who was baorn in Raii in Iran. In search of a remedy for the
disease, he investigated it from the purely medical standpoint and
wrote the first book on the subject, called, <i>Al-Judri wa al-Hasba.</i>
This was translated into Latin, the academic language of ancient
Europe, in 1565 in Venice. It was later translated into Greek and other
European languages, and thus spread all over Europe. Its English
translation, published in London in 1848, was entitled, <i>A Treatise on Smallpox and Measles.</i></p>
<p>Researchers have accepted that this is the first medical book on
smallpox in the whole of recorded history. Prior to this, no one had
ever done research on this topic.</p>
<p>After reading Al-Razi's book, Edward Jenner (1749-1823), the English
physician who became the inventor of vaccination, was led to making a
clinical investigation of the disease. He carried on his research over
a twenty year period, ultimately establishing the connection between
cowpox and smallpox. In 1796, he carried out his first practical
experiment in inoculation. This was a success, and the practice spread
rapidly, in spite of violent opposition from certain quarters, until,
in 1877, it was announced by the UN that for the first time in history,
smallpox had been eradicated.</p>

<p>Abdullah ibn Baytar (d. 1248) was the best known botanist and
pharmacist of Spain, in fact, of the Muslim world. He travelled as a
herbalist in Spain and throughout North Africa, and later entered the
service of th Ayyubid al-Malik al-Kamil in Cairo as chief herbalist.
From Egypt he made extensive trips throughout Syria and Asia Minor. One
of his two celebrated works, <i>Al-Mughni fi al Aswiyah al-Mufradah,</i> is on materia medica.  The other, <i>Al-Jami`fi al-Adwiya al-Mufradah,</i>
is a collection of simple remedies from the animal, vegetable and
mineral worlds embodying Greek and Arabic data supplemented by the
author's own experiments and researches. It stands out as the foremost
medieval treatise of its kind. Some 1400 items are considered, of which
300, including about 200 plants, were novelties. The number of authors
quoted is about one hundred and fifty, of whom twenty were Greek. Parts
of the Latin version of Ibn al Baytar's <i>Simplicia</i> were printed as late as 1758 at Cremona.</p>
<p>In fact, the Muslims started investigating herbal species, and succeeded in enriching Dioscorides' Herbal by 2000 species.</p>

<p>After materia medica, astronomy and mathematics, the Arabs made
their greatest scientific contribution in chemistry. This brought
chemistry out of the sphere of alchemy and gave it the status of a
regular science based on observation. In the study of chemistry and
other physical sciences the Arabs introduced the objective experiment,
a decided improvement over the hazy speculations of the Greeks. It was
through them that the world was first introduced to the scientific
method. </p>
<p>Jabir ibn Hayyan (d. 817) used findings based theron in his
scientific studies, the written accounts of which were transmitted to
Europe in translations. Thinking went on developing along these lines
until it formed the basis for experimental science as it is known today.</p>

<p>After al-Razi, Jabir ibn Hayyan (721-815) is ranked greatest in the
field of medieval chemical science. He more clearly recognized and
stated the importance of experimentation than any other early
alchemist, and made noteworthy adavanced in both the theory and
practice of chemistry.</p>
<p>Jabir's books were held as the final authority on chemistry in
Europe uptill the fifteenth century. The initial ladder to the modern
western chemistry of the eighteenth century was produced by Jabir. It
is believed that Jabir wrote two thousand books on different sciences.
So many scholarly books had never been written before the Muslim eposh
by any single writer.</p>

<b><font color="#800000" size="4"></font></b><p><b><font color="#800000" size="4"><a name="Historiography">Historiography</a></font></b></p>
<p>History should not focus solely on royal actions and prerogatives
throughout the ages, but should be a study of the sum of all activities
of all groups of human beings, whatever the framework, political or
civilizational, within which they interact. In the long history of
mankind, this approach, developed only during the last few centuries,
is relatively new. History, or historiography, is now equated with
"man-story" as opposed to the "King-story" of the pre-modern era.
"King-story", made up of elaborate descriptions of kings, along with
copious details of the palaces they occupied and the generals they
commanded, had made no mention of the common man, even if his
achievements were marked by greatness. The only man considered worthy
of mention was the one whose head was adorned by a crown. Ancient
history thus amounted to a belittling of humanity in general.</p>
<p>In old historical records, the most striking omissions are the lives
and influence of the great prophets of the world. Today, people would
find it very strange if a history of the freedom struggle of India laid
no stress on the role Ghandi, or if a history of the erstwhile USSR
omitted Lenin altogether. But a far strange history is one bereft of
all mention of those pious souls, who were the messengers of God. The
sole exception to this rule of omission is the Final Prophet, the
Prophet Muhammed (pbuh). The reason for his prominent inclusion in
historical records is that, by setting in motion the Islamic
revolution, he was able to change exactly those factors -- the
undemocratic, polytheistic and superstitious nature of society -- which
in the past had been responsible for such astonishing lucanae in the
writing of human history. There can be no doubt that it was the Islamic
revolution which made it possible for historiography to proceed on
ceientific lines.</p>
<p>In known human history, Ibn Khaldun (1331-1406) is the only
historian to have changed the pattern of historiography. It was he who
raised historiography from the level of mere King-story to the level of
genuine man-story. "Kingology" was changed into sociology. The truth is
that the science known today as sociology is the gift of Ibn Khaldun.
He himself claimed that he was the founder of sociology, and there is
no reason to dispute his claim. </p>
<p>Khaldun's greatness was acknowledged in a similar vein by Robert
Flint: "As a theorist on history he had no equal in any age or countgry
until Vico appeared, more than three hundred years later; Plato,
Aristotle and Augustine were not his peers."</p>
<p>It was indeed Ibn Khaldun who gave to Europe the modern science of
history. And it was Islam which bestowed this gift upon him. The
Islamic revolution produced Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Khaldun produced the
modern science of history.</p>
<p>Professor Philip K. Hitti writes:</p>
<blockquote>"The frame of Ibn-Khaldun rests on his Muqaddama
(Introduction to his book on history). In it he presented for the first
time a theory of historical development which takes due cognizance of
the physical facts of climate and geography aw well as of the moral and
spiritual forces at work. As one who endeavoured to formulate laws of
national progress and decay, Ibn Khaldun may be considered the
discoverer -- as he himself claimed -- of the true scope and nature of
history, or atleast the real founder of the science of sociology. No
Arab writer, indeed no European, had ever taken a view of history at
once so comprehensive and philosophic. By the consensus of critical
opinion Ibn-Khaldun was the greatest historical philosopher Islam
produced, and one of the greatest of all time"</blockquote>
<p>In Book I of the Muqaddamah, Ibn Khaldun sketches a general
sociology; in Books II and III, a sociology of politics; in Book IV a
sociology of urban life; in Book V, a sociology of economiics; and in
Book VI, a sociology of knowledge. The work is studded with brilliant
observations on historiography, economics, politics, and education. It
is held together by his central concept of <i>asabiyah,</i> or social
cohesion. Thus he laid the foundation of a science of history which is
not based on the descriptions of kings, but which is, in a vaster
sense, based on the economics, politics, education, religion, ethics,
and culture of the whole nations.</p>
<p>Historians have generally acknowledged that the science of history
remained undeveloped before the emergence of Ibn Khaldun, and that he
was the first person to develop a philosophy of history. The <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> even goes so far as to say that "he developed one of the world's most significant philosophies of history." </p>
